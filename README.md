## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954012426280509440/1121098477993218219/image.png)

This documentation provides an overview of the Queueing System Calculator application, a web-based tool for calculating various performance metrics of different queueing models. The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and it utilizes HTML templates for rendering the user interface.


## Built With

The project consists of the following files:

index.html: This HTML template file defines the structure and layout of the web interface, including the navigation bar, tabs, input forms, and result display sections.

app.py: This file contains the Flask application code, including the route definitions for different endpoints and the calculation logic for each queueing model.



* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
* [HTML](https://html.com/)

## Getting Started






### Prerequisites

Dependencies:
The Queueing System Calculator application has the following dependencies:
Flask: A Python web framework used for building the web application.
math: A Python standard library module used for mathematical calculations.

### Installation

Installation
To install and run the application, follow these steps:
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
Install the Flask framework by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

<code>pip install flask</code>

Save the app.py and index.html files in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

<code>python app.py</code>

Open a web browser and enter http://localhost:5000 in the address bar to access the application.


## Usage

The Queueing System Calculator provides a web-based interface for calculating performance metrics of different queueing models. The following steps outline the basic usage of the application:

Open the application in a web browser by entering http://localhost:5000 in the address bar.
The application displays a navigation bar and a set of tabs for different queueing models (M/M/2, M/G/2, and G/G/2).
Click on a tab to select the desired queueing model.
Each tab presents a form for entering input parameters specific to the selected model.
Fill in the required input parameters and click the "Calculate" button.
The application processes the input and displays the calculated performance metrics in the results section below the form.
